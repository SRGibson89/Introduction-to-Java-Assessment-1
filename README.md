I was tasked to write a program that asks he user to enter their name and presents them with 3 options for 2 programs and a quit option, the program is to until the user selects option 3.  Option 1: User name program, Admin user enter the person first-name and surname the program then makes a user-name by taking the first letter of their first-name and adding it to their surname (example Steven Gibson user-name is SGibson),  Option 2: Is to ask the user for a number and show its factorial (example number = 5 factorial is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1=120.  Option 3: Quits with a goodbye message.
